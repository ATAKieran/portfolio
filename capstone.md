# Robot Arm Satellite Positioning Simulator (RASPS)

This was my computer engineering design capstone project. Myself and three other students were tasked with developing a "test bed system to support hardware-in-the-loop simulation and modelling of satellite proximity operations." In practice, this meant restoring an existing 3D-printed robot arm, mounting it to a rail system, and writing control software for the combined arm-rail system.
